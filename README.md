## 'Fisodd' Because "F Is Odd"

Perhaps pronounced something like "fizz-sod", the name comes from the observation that 'F' is an _odd number_.

For many the idea that 'F' is a number just seems odd &mdash; as in _strange_.
But for those who spend too much time working with the lower level interfaces in computing,
'F' is a perfectly valid number representing the value 15, which is odd &mdash; as in _not even_.

There's a [full explanation](https://www.fisodd.com/post/f-is-odd/) on [my website](https://www.fisodd.com/).

### What's Here

My current repositories at GitHub tend to fall into two categories:

- Website tools &mdash;
notably support of [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
this includes the pinned repositories below.
- Data Visualizations &mdash;
as a life-long learner of Data Science, occasionally some of my data projects have reason to escape my local servers and end up becoming hosted here.

### What's Elsewhere

Much of my work these days is related to [SPEC](https://www.spec.org), though a few bits make it to [my own site](https://www.fisodd.com/).
