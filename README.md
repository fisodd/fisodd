### 'Fisodd' Because "F Is Odd"

Perhaps pronounced something like "fizz-sod", the name comes from the observation that 'F' is an _odd number_.

For many the idea that 'F' is a number just seems odd (as in _strange_),
but for those who spend too much time working with the lower level interfaces in computing,
'F' is a perfectly valid number representing the value 15, which is odd (as in _not even_).

There's a [full explanation](https://www.fisodd.com/post/f-is-odd/) on [my website](https://www.fisodd.com/).

#### What's Here

My repositories at GitHub tend to fall into two categories:

- Website tools,
notably support of [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) in (Hugo)[https://gohugo.io/]
- Data Visualizations,
as a life-long learner of Data Science, some of my projects escape my local servers and end up becoming hosted here

#### What's Elsewhere

Much of my work these days is related to [SPEC](https://www.spec.org).
